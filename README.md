<p>After nearly 2 years of maintaining <b>RandomLootChest</b> project, It is time to push it forwards and open new project called <b>RandomLootEntity</bold>! Like RandomLootChest, from the beginning of existance, it is basic Minecraft plugin that allows you to change <bold>entities</b> drops! Simple and kind of useful!</p>

So... What can this plugin do?

- **Completely** remove default entity drops! (including exp!)
- **Add** your own drop to entities!
- **Add** some experience to drop!
- **Drop** all items to your inventory!
